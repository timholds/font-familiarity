prompt for updating the styling:
Let's give the frontend.html (which uses style.css and app.js) some love. I've attached a couple images showing how it looks before and after a user uploads an image. 

Another claude instance has shared their advice:

-Hide the "No file chosen" text that appears next to the button

-Style the upload area to be more modern and visually appealing

-Move the "Analyze another image" button to appear right after upload

-Only show the filename under the image preview, not next to the button

-Add subtle hover effects and transitions for a more polished look

The UI will maintain all the same functionality while looking cleaner and more professional.

I want you to feel inspired by Edwards Tufte think carefully about what the most elegant way to display the information visually is.
