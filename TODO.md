[ ] fix the health check for the container that is unhealthy on the server


prompt for updating the styling:
Let's give the frontend.html (which uses style.css and app.js) some love. I've attached a couple images showing how it looks before and after a user uploads an image. 

Another claude instance has shared their advice:

-Hide the "No file chosen" text that appears next to the button

-Style the upload area to be more modern and visually appealing

-Move the "Analyze another image" button to appear right after upload

-Only show the filename under the image preview, not next to the button

-Add subtle hover effects and transitions for a more polished look

The UI will maintain all the same functionality while looking cleaner and more professional.

I want you to feel inspired by Edwards Tufte think carefully about what the most elegant way to display the information visually is. 

As a reminder, the information is the image the user uploaded (either via drag and drop or by file menu upload) which contains some font we want to find similar fonts to. We then display a list of 5 of the most similar fonts, and want affordances for the user to clear out or to reupload. 

One super low hanging fruit would be to actually load the suggested fonts in since we have the name and to render the example sentence in the font!

This is a side project so we don't want the code to be complicated, and we should stick to industry standards unless we have a good reason to deviate. 

In your first message, do not write any code. Instead, think carefully and come back to clarify constraints and criteria so we can nail this in one shot. Anyway, let's begin improving the page
